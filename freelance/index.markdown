# Freelance Front End & JavaScript Developer

Between 2013 and 2016 I was freelancing full-time, and I've been a professional developer since 2010. In that time I’ve worked for a few great companies and with a lot of great people. Some of them have been kind enough to share some thoughts about how our work went, which you can read here. Alternatively, learn more about me or have a look at my CV.

## Developer for Hire

Currently, I'm employed in a permanent role at [Jungle Scout](https://junglescout.com) here in Vancouver. However, below I've left the original text from this freelancing page from back when I was a freelancer.

If you need someone to come into your office and work with the team on your product, **I’m your man**. I specialise in anything to do with **JavaScript on the back end or front end**, and I have a keen eye for **web design as well as development**. I also have experience with iOS applications and the .NET stack.

<blockquote>
First up, Dan is great fun to work with and he has masses of enthusiasm about pretty much anything.  He is knowledgeable about a great deal of web software development, both client side and server side, and also had great input into user experience and usability design of the app he built for us.

</blockquote>

I’m open to all sorts of offers. For me, being an independent developer is about working on **lots of interesting projects**, meeting **great people** and getting **experience** in many fields and technologies. Whatever your situation, budget or goals, get in touch and let’s see if we can work something out.

<blockquote>
Dan was a great addition to our team when we needed him most: in the run up to our iOS app launch. He settled in extremely quickly and got on well with the rest of the team. His work was exceptional and he required little management. We couldn't have been happier!

## Convinced?

Please get in touch anyway if you think I might be the right man for the job, it doesn't hurt to chat. I’m not looking for a permanent role, but if you think you’ve got an interesting job - especially if it involves travelling abroad - please get in touch.

Think we could work together?

## FAQ

### What tools do you use?

While developing I mostly use VSCode, and I design almost everything that requires design work in Sketch. I often use [Marvel](https://marvelapp.com/) for creating design/interaction prototypes, and [Interfake](https://github.com/basicallydan/interfake) for API prototypes.

### What technologies do you use?

Most of the time I build backends with Ruby on Rails, or NodeJS, with various libraries like Express, Mongoose and some of [my own stuff](https://github.com/basicallydan/interfake). On the frontend, I'm very familiar with React, Backbone, Underscore, Knockout and jQuery, but I'm comfortable using most of the main MV* frameworks such as Ember or Angular. For automation I use gulp, or good old fashioned makefiles.

### Are there any kinds of projects you'd prefer?

I'm pretty good at prototypes and MVPs, but I also enjoy what I call "technical debt collection", which involves refactoring an older code into one which is more maintainable, testable and extendable.

### Where are you based?

Right now I'm in Vancouver, Canada.

### Will you work remotely?

I'm open to doing work for people from anywhere in the world, and work remotely

### Will you work on-site?

I prefer not to take very long-term on-site jobs, but I'm more than happy to meet in person wherever possible and, if need be, work in your office for a few weeks at a time.

### Are you looking for a permanent job?

At the moment, I have a permanent job - I'm not interested in anything new right now - but neer say never. Especially if you have something I could work on in my free time, [get in touch](mailto:dan@danhough.com?subject=I have some work for you).
