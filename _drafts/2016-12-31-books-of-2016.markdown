## [Burmese Days](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B003FXCSRM) by George Orwell

I read this book right after I got back from my [six month trip through Asia](/travel), since my interest in colonialism had been piqued by my trip. It's sad, but an important perspective on the terrible ways that the British treated their "subjects" in that era. Semi-autobiographical.

## Futuristic Violence and Fancy Suits by David Wong

Ironic story set in a over-the-top ultraviolent future envisaged by someone getting their predictions about the future from WIRED Magazine. The fancy suits aspect of this is seriously underplayed, though.

## The Invisible Man by H.G. Wells

A surprising story about a madman who stumbles upon on the forumla for a serum to turn him invisible, and thus goes about being extra mad. Interesting and fast-paced, but somehow I expected something else. Something a little less ridiculous. Nevertheless, really enjoyable.

## The Island Of Doctor Moreau by H.G. Wells

## One's Company by Peter Fleming

I read this during a trip to Russia, and I can tell you that reading a book which features a train journey in a country you're also taking a train journey in, 80 years later, is a doubly fascinating experience.

## The Colour Of Magic

## HERLAND

## The Home DIY Expert (ongoing)

## A Room Of One's Own
