A forum is a meeting or meeting place intended for discussing some topic. In
RL, at least, that is the case. On the web, a forum is a message board. It's a
website on which users can create their own topics or "threads" for other users
to weigh in. They're still around today, but most people don't use them much.
Once though, at least to me, it seemed like the web forum was the most important
medium of information exchange out there, and it seemed ubiqutious.

It's very difficult to remember the first time I used a web forum. It could be
back in the days when _Gamespy_ was the ultimate source of all things gaming
online, and they had a different "Planet" website for each franchise. Back then,
in 2001, I was really into the god simulator _Black and White_, and its modding
community.

_Black and White_ featured a "creature" in each game, which was
essentially a giant animal incarnation of your will as a god. You could order it
to do things to your worshippers, and decorate its computer-generated hide with
simple "tattoos", which were just GIFs the game loaded in with transparent
backgrounds, usually silhouttes of simple abstract shapes.

On the _Planet Black and White_ forums, people would trade little miniature mods
for the game, in the form of creature tattoos we'd put together in cracked
copies of Photoshop, so we could decorate our virtual pets in our own style. I
got so into this, that along with my good friend Omair, I started a website
called the Black and White Tattoo Parlour. Here, we hosted our own tattoos, and
tried to convince other artists to allow us to convince their tattoos. We most
certainly had our own forum for this website, of course. Every website back then
had a forum. It's just what you did.

# Every forum

In 2001, anybody who started a gaming-related website would find some way to
host or associate a forum with their site. You did this because you were
probably a member of a few different, popular gaming forums with hundreds if not
thousands of active users. You probably weren't a moderator–that is, someone
with the power to moderate the content of certain forums' sub-forums or
"boards"–and you almost certainly weren't an administrator of the popular
forums.

So, given the simplicity of setting up forum software, you started your own
forum.

_Ezboard_ was one of a multitude of websites which allowed web users to create
their own forums on any topic they chose. At the _Black and White Tattoo
Parlour_, this is what we used. I didn't take this particularly seriously. If
you look at the web archive of this site, it's bleak. There's only one user,
_Dannyboy132001_ (I was 13 in August 2001 when the forum launched), and only
one post.

This singular, sad post, created on 10th August at 10:39:29 am simply reads:

> How do you rate the site?
> 1-worst
> 10-best

I can't remember whether this was an automated post which comes with every new
forum or whether I was naïve enough to think that anybody would reply, but it's
a striking message which I feel captures the futility of the amateur forum
administrator's mission quite nicely.

I'd be willing to bet that over 80% of the forums hosted online tell a similar
tale: someone started it with grand ideas of a wonderful, vibrant community of
likeminded netizens, but it never picked up and was left, inevitably, to decay.

The other 20%, though, also told similar stories to one another.

# Common threads

```
Talk here about the way that every forum had a similar set of threads and boards

* Off-topic board
* "Politics" or "Real world discussion"
* The introduction thread (on PCGF it was the "Say Hello" thread.)
* Games like "word association" – mention Lemon Demon song
* Pics
```

# Evolution

Talk about how web forums evolved. I started to use reddit and digg and stopped visiting forum so much
