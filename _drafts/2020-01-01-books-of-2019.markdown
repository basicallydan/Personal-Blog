## Convenience Store Woman by Sayaka Murata

Finished: 5th Jan 2019.

What an unexpectedly delightful book. I knew I'd enjoy it when I spotted it in the store but I didn't know what to expect from the actual content. It's a strange call-to-arms for anybody who doesn't really fit society's mold, as well as a satisfying and funny stream-of-consciousness. A mundane situation, explored deeply. Great fun, quick and easy read.
