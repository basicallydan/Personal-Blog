## Convenience Store Woman by Sayaka Murata

Finished: 5th Jan 2019.

What an unexpectedly delightful book. I knew I'd enjoy it when I spotted it in the store but I didn't know what to expect from the actual content. It's a strange call-to-arms for anybody who doesn't really fit society's mold, as well as a satisfying and funny stream-of-consciousness. A mundane situation, explored deeply. Great fun, quick and easy read.

## If Cats Disappeared From The World by

Finished: 21st Jan 2019

Pretty thought-provoking early on as the author explores what the world would be like if various modern conveniences suddenly disappeared without anybody really noticing. About 75% of the way in, though, I sort of lost interest. I'm not sure why, but as the story became more about the protagonist and less about the alternative world imagined earlier on, it became less compelling.

## Kitchen by Banana ...something INSERT HERE

Finished: 2nd Feb 2019

A curious novel. Much like _If Cats Disappeared From The World_ I found myself losing interest towards the end as the point of the story became less clear. Strangely, however, after the _Kitchen_ story ends (it has no named chapters, just asterisks denoting a change of scene), there's a good 30 pages left which start a whole new, seemingly-unrelated story which was _much_ better and more my cup of tea.

## Drawing the Border: The Irish Border in British Politics by Ivan Gibbons

Finished: 9th Feb 2019

Like many Brits, I've long been unintentionally ignorant of Britain's relationship with Ireland and the history thereof. Over the last few years I like to think I've become better-informed, more sensitive and more sympathetic, but there's still a lot I don't know about this subject. I picked up this book hoping to fill in some gaps and it helped a lot. Anybody living in Great Britain - especially if you're English: this book will make up for one of several important missing pages from your school history textbooks.
