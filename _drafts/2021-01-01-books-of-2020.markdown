## Three Day Road by Joseph Boyden

Finished: 24th May 2020

First indigenous-authored book I've read as far as I know. I was given this as a gift after expressing interest in learning more about First Nations culture and although it came with the caveat of "Joseph Boyden is a controvertial figure" it was a good read. Very compelling and I enjoyed the circular storytelling structure. Quite a horrific account of the experiences of many in the First World War.
