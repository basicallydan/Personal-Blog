## Three Day Road by Joseph Boyden

Finished: 24th May 2020

First indigenous-authored book I've read as far as I know. I was given this as a gift after expressing interest in learning more about First Nations culture and although it came with the caveat of "Joseph Boyden is a controvertial figure" it was a good read. Very compelling and I enjoyed the circular storytelling structure. Quite a horrific account of the experiences of many in the First World War.

## Hyperbole and a Half by Allie Brosh

Finished: 31st May 2020

A nice, easy, calming read was just what I needed after a horrific WW1-set novel. I used to read a _lot_ of webcomics but somehow avoided reading Allie Brosh's. I am of course familiar with the "\_\_\_ all the things!" meme which came from her blog, but it took a quarter of reading the book before realising. Quite a funny, entertaining book, which is very relatable.
