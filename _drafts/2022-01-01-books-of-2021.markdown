## The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet

This is a charming, sweet space opera with witty characters on a long journey, told in a slice-of-life kind of way which is strangely relatable. Easy reading, really enjoyable with just the right amount of tension to make it a page turner. As a fan of space operas on the screen or the page, this was perfect for me.

## The Memory Police by Yoko Ogawa

Incredibly gripping, evocative story which appears to be some kind of allegory. It's a little dystopian, has 1984 vibes but isn't quite as aggressive. This story is an allegory, and it makes me think of situations where one feels like they are the only person who doesn't see clearly what's going on, like everybody else has fallen for some kind of insane, obvious trick. Very thought-provoking story.
