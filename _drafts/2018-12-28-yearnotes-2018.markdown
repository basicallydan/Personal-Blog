## Work

<!-- Moved from team lead to product manager -->

## Comedy

At the start of this year I started doing stand-up comedy. I took a course which lasted a few weeks, and the instructor told us that we need to take the bull by the horns and just gig as much as possible. So that's what I did.

It was a pretty crazy year.

I started slow, doing maybe 1 or 2 gigs a week, sometimes taking a week off, but quickly built it up. Eventually I was doing 12-16 gigs each month. Now, that may not seem like a lot, but when you consider that for each one I essentially need to spend about 2-4 hours sitting in a bar or theatre (usually bar) while other acts do their thing, it becomes quite a commitment. And the other acts are mostly good, too, but not always.

My life became very much all about comedy. I can say with confidence that this year, my health has taken a hit because I have prioritised this over all other things. I haven't eaten as well, I've drank more.

But it wasn't for nothing. I learned a lot in this time, and I've enjoyed most of it.

...highlights + lowlights, what I learned...

But every time I saw a musical comediam though, I thought, that could be me. I should be doing that.

## Music & Busking

<!-- Hit 50% of the pitches -->

I'm more optimistic about the musical parts of my performance life this year. I did a LOT of busking and I recorded a LOT of songs.
