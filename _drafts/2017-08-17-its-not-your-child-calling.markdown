Your phone rings. It's your son's phone number. You pick up. He sounds a little bit frantic.

"Mum, I'm sorry but I need to borrow some money."

This isn't the first time he's had to borrow money to pay for something. Usually it's pretty innocent. A deposit on a new apartment, a plane ticket which he _can't quite afford_ until payday, or a credit card debt he's built up this month over-spending a little bit on work lunches.

"Love, of course, how much do you need?"

"Â£750, it's to pay a bill for an emergency boiler repair. My landlord won't cover it."

"Sure, shall I send the money to your normal account?"

"Actually can I just take your card details? I've forgotten them. I need to pay over the phone."

Sounds believeable, right? I've paid for things over the phone loads of times. Especially with medium-sized local businesses, like plumbers or gas engineers - sometimes my local council asks me to pay for stuff by card over the phone.

You probably didn't even question it. Maybe you're panicking, you don't want your child getting into debt and going out on the street - or worse, coming back home to live with you.

So, you take out your debit card and read out the long card number, the expiry date and, just in case, the three-digit security code.
