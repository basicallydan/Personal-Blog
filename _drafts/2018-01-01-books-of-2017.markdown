## [Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World](https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/Hard-Boiled-Wonderland-End-World-Haruki-Murakami/0099448785/?tag=daplad-21) by Haruki Murakami

I became quite interested in Japanese Culture in 2016 and for this reason decided early on in 2017 to become acquainted with Japan's (arguably) most internationally well-known author. Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World, originally 世界の終りとハードボイルド・ワンダーランド, is not the sort of book I would like to spoil by talking about it too much here, but I will say that it was certainly unlike most novels I've ever read. Murakami demonstrates sharpness and wit, and a sense of existential resignedness which I tend to find quite appealing. The "hump"[1] of this book was quite far in for me, about 30%, but I did quite enjoy it.

### Notes

[1]: The "hump" refers to the point at which I become desperately compelled to continue reading a book, and do not want to put it down. Up until this point it can be a struggle, but I don't think a book is necessarily bad for having a deep hump. Some stories/concepts just take a little bit more setup than others. And for some books the hump never comes, but for most it does. Once I am past this point I refer to it as being "over the hump". An easy book for me to read is one where the hump comes early.
