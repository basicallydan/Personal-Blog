Chancery Lane is _the windiest station on the network_. I don't have any statistics or science to back that up but seriously, it's so windy. I could barely stand up straight.

This time around I had a little blackboard, but sadly I didn't get any chalk in time so I put some craft paper over it with "TIPS APPRECIATED =)" written on in felt-tip pen.

Also, for the first time, I brought along a portable amplifier (Roland Micro Cube) and microphone! It helped.

I actually got to the station about an hour late. So, while I was only playing for 53 minutes I managed to rake in £18.64, which works out to £20.71 per hour. Huge improvement on [last week](/busking/2017-10-21-kings-cross). If only I'd gotten there on time!

## The first tip

During the first verse of _New Shoes_ by Paolo Nutini my good friend Jon started walking by, so I shouted at him in my amplified voice through the microphone. It took a couple of shouts before he realised, and he _insisted_ that I accept his first tip of £2.05!

## The biggest tip

A very cool-looking pair of teenagers (whom I would suggest were probably tourists) swaggered on by during _Fat-Bottomed Girls_ and casually chucked £4.50 right into my guitar case. Pretty good. Not the largest I've ever received, but still uncommonly large. Thanks, tourist!

## The best performance

This time it was probably _Breakfast at Tiffany's_. Half way through the second verse a group of drunk football fans came and started singing along. One guy didn't really get that I was in the middle of the verse so he sang the chorus, and I skipped ahead to satisfy him. As entertaining as he was, he didn't think to tip me in return for my skipping the second verse, but thankfully his ashamed-looking friend did.

A full two minutes after finishing this song as I was packing up, someone came along with a pound coin and told me, with a very serious look on his face, that I "might be the next Ed Sheeran". I'm fairly sure he meant it as a compliment. I told him he was very kind and he went on his way. Not a bad way to end a session!

## How to improve

Having a microphone helped a lot, but I still need more tunes that I can rely on. And getting some chalk will help.
