A new pitch! And really far from home, too! Hammersmith is absolutely not in my neighbourhood, and somewhere I normally only ever go to for gigs at the Apollo, or, passing through, on my way to Heathrow Airport. It's a nice place, around the corner from the entrance to a Starbucks, so there should be plenty of passers-by who've already demonstrated they're prepared to pay money for something disappointing, which is my target audience.

Today the good folks of Hammersmith were generous enough to give me £23.63, mostly in the form of £1 coins. So, £11.81 for me and £11.82 for [Crisis](https://www.crisis.org.uk/).

## Some notable moments

Strangely, Hammersmith's busking pitch is only marked only by a "Help Point", which is misleading because a man armed only with a guitar, amp and microphone is not the most helpful person in an emergency.

Nonetheless, I wasn't called on for heroic duties at any point. If anything, I caused more trouble than help when someone, while trying to chuck a pound in my case, ran into somebody else. Oops!

Hammersmith definitely has the oldest average age of all the places I've played so far, with a fair portion of the passers-by being quite elderly which meant they had plenty of time to hear my music, and I'm pretty sure constituted most of my tippers. My favourite old person today was a nice lady who came and spoke to me at the beginning of one of my songs (_Bored Bored Bored_) and asked me my name. I said, "Daniel", and she said, "I've got one of those", like I'm a Pokémon. She then gave me £2 and wished me luck. What a nice lady!

## The first tip

_Breakfast At Tiffany's_ has become my warmup song because it's _so easy_ and it works _so well_ with my voice. I didn't anticipate how much people would enjoy it. I got £2.50 from two people. (one of whom was the lady mentioned in the last paragraph.)

## The biggest tips

Just like [last week](/busking/2018-01-20-south-kensington), Breakfast at Tiffany's was a hit. But why? What happened to last year's love of _Torn_? Maybe at the end of the year, a sad-sounding song like _Torn_ is popular because people are fed up, but at the beginning of the year, a happy-sounding (but actually not lyrically positive) song like _Breakfast at Tiffany's_ is popular because people are full of renewed vigour and positivity!

Or maybe Hammersmith happens to be populated by people who really liked _Deep Blue Something_ in the 90s.

## The best performance

I reckon my best was a rendition of _Why does it always rain on me_, but given what a bright and sunny morning it was in Hammersmith I don't think the song quite resonated with people.
