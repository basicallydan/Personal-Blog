Last weekend, one day before work, I took a quick hop to Canary Wharf, for the 8am-10am slot. I have in the past tried to get a later slot (e.g. 6pm or 8pm) or a weekend slot but they're usually booked up by the time I try to get them. There must be something appealing about them.

The takings: £9.67 in total - so, £4.84 for [Crisis](https://www.crisis.org.uk/) and the rest for me. It was a just-under-one-hour set because I had to run off to do my day job, so the hourly wage for this spot at this time is £11.60. Not terrible. That's the 24th best hourly wage out of all the busking sessions I've ever done, 52nd best in terms of total takings - but it was a short one.

## Some notable moments

### Euros

It's not unusual to be given foreign currencies. The most common is definitely the Euro. This time around, my first tip was all Euros!

### New amp

The reason this blog post is three months after the last one I made is because two things got in the way in that time:

* I was on holiday for 2.5 weeks
* I was taking part in a busking competition

The busking competition went well, although I did not get through to the final sadly. However, out of it I did manage to snag myself a barely-used, cut-price busking amp, which had been used for buskers during the competition. This is the Roland Cube - an upgrade from my previous amp, the Micro Cube.

The main difference is that the cube can take two inputs: one from my mic (as before) and one for my guitar. It's also a heck of a lot louder. It's heavier though, so with my microphone stand in tow as well as this, I think it's time I invested in a little hand cart to carry my stuff. Hopefully by the next blog post I'll have figured that out.

## The first tip

As usual, I started with _Breakfast at Tiffany's_ again! This didn't work get anybody going, nor did The Lazy Song and nor did New Shoes. But _Don't Look Back in Anger_ did - my first tipper was the person with the Euros!

## The biggest tip

_Don't Look Back in Anger_ this time, at £4.

## How to improve

Honestly, I was pretty lazy in getting to this one and I should be a little more diligent! I need a hand cart too, so - next time!
