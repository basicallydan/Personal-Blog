Second time in as many weeks! I practiced a bunch of songs that I played last

Again I went with no signage or encouragement to tip - just my guitar case and guitar. New strings, too.

I've done some better performances, but it was an improvement on [last week](/busking/2017-10-14-north-greenwich). I earned £14.76, which over a two-hour period means £7.38 an hour, more than £2 shy of the London Living Wage of £9.75. I think I need a sign.

Nonetheless, the practice of the last week on songs I haven't performed in a while paid off, because I'm expanding my repertoire once again. I've got a few new songs I'd like to try learning, too.

### The first tip

For _Big Yellow Taxi_. Not sure who did it, but it wasn't a particularly memorable rendition. Thanks for the £2 though, stranger!

### The biggest tip

A young man came up from the platform to pay me £2.50 during a pretty good performance of _The Lazy Song_ by Bruno Mars, and told me " Ireally like your song". I didn't have time to eschew the credit for this excellent song, so I'm Bruno Mars now.

### The best performance

Easily the first performance of _New Shoes_ by Paolo Nutini. Really excellent I think. I put heart and soul into it. Many people watched from afar... but nobody tipped me for it. Oh well!

Special mention to a performance of Oasis's _Don't Look Back In Anger_ which captured the imagination of a friendly man and two women who all sang along and even got a few other people involved. And maybe the video they took will show up on Instagram or Facebook, we'll have to see!

## How to improve

Keep practicing the classics, the money-makers. Practice my own songs too, they might work well - worth a try.
