My first time busking in a few months... and my first time at North Greenwich! It's a nice place to play, great acoustics with plenty of space for the performer.

I went with no signage or encouragement to tip - just my guitar case and guitar, plus a camera and microphone to record the performance.

To be honest, it wasn't my best performance but there were some good moments. I only earned £7.64 - the smallest amount I've ever earned! But, I did get €5. If that had been GBP it would've been my third smallest earnings.
