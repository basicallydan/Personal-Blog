London Bridge (Pitch 2) is probably the pitch I pass most often in my life since I change between the Northern and Jubilee line pretty often. Yet, this was my first time performing here. At 10am on a Saturday, I won't lie, it's not a great time to perform. Could have been worse though. Â£14.52 in total - so, Â£7.26 for [Crisis](https://www.crisis.org.uk/).

This was mostly in the form of Â£1 coins, but for the first time I took...

_drumroll_

**CONTACTLESS PAYMENTS!**

## Some notable moments

### Contactless

As you may have [read in the news](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/27/busking-joins-cashless-society-as-musicians-start-using-card-readers), buskers in London are now being offered an off-the-shelf solution for taking contactless payments frictionlessly.

We could do it before, but as far as I know, all the most popular contactless point-of-sale solutions required the vendor (in this case, a busker) to set an amount to pay every time they wanted to take a payment. What we need is a fixed-rate payment system which doesn't force the busker to stop playing.

Thankfully, [Busk in London](https://buskinlondon.com) and [iZettle](https://izettle.co.uk) have been quietly working together to get something going on that front.

I'm happy to report that out of 24 tippers, 2 of them were forward-thinking enough to use the contactless reader.

The first person to use it asked at the end of _The Lazy Song_. She came up, said, "May I? I'd really like to give one a go!"

I said sure, she tapped - and Â£1 went through! Brilliant! THE FUTURE IS NOW.

### Recognition

You might know that recently I've started performing stand-up comedy: well, believe it or not only three-and-a-half months into that endeavour I was _recognised_!

By a fellow circuit comedian called Ruth ðŸ˜… we had a little chat, shared upcoming gig details and parted ways. Tell you what though, I felt a lot more upbeat after a nice chat since it had been a fairly quiet morning thus far.

## The first tip

I started with _Breakfast at Tiffany's_ as I so often do, but it didn't get any money. Got a smile or two though. The first tip was during _New Shoes_, my second song. I got about Â£1.50 from two people.

## The best performance & biggest tip

It wasn't my best day ever, but I did a reasonably good rendition of _Bored Bored Bored_, which happened to be the biggest tap, too!

## How to improve

First of all: don't do London Bridge on a Saturday at 10! Try and book it at 12. I'm starting to realise over various performances how much my mood and attitude can affect my performance. I always feel chirpier after I've had a good chat with someone, especially during a performance.
