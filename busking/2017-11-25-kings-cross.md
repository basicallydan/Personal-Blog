I had high hopes for Kings Cross on Saturday. At midday, it's a very busy station.

I was only there from 12:00 to 13:30 as I had plans after my session at 3, so it was less than usual, but it wasn't as

### Some notable moments

- During my first rendition of _Fat Bottomed Girls_, someone came over and apologised for not having any money. She asked if I would accept wine instead. I said it was too generous but she insisted, sooooo.... she gave me a gift bag of wine. There was a gift tag attached reading, "Dear Sergio ... Lots of love, you friend Tammy". Sorry, Sergio.
- At the end of the same song, a group of women apologised again for having no money to give me. Instead, they offered a box of muffins. Obviously, I accepted.
- Pitch 1 at Kings Cross is right next to a map of the Northern Line. I got far more directions requests than usual...

### The first tip

Thankfully the trend of getting the first tip in the first song continues - _Breakfast At Tiffany's_, about 50p! Woop!

### The biggest tips

Another trend continues: during _Torn_, I earned about £3.50 from 4 different people!

### The best performance

Probably my first rendition of _Get Back_ of the day was the best. I love singing that song, it's easy to get super into it and really shouty and emotional.

## How to improve

I probably shouldn't overdo the busking. At the end of the session I was pretty nackered after having done two the previous day also. My fingers were well and truly spent!
