On Thursday I took a day off from my day job to do some busking! My second stop was South Kensington (Pitch 1). I've never played here before, but I've passed it many times on the way to or fron Royal Albert Hall or the Science Museum.

Basically, it's in a long subterranean tunnel which takes you from South Kensington Station to very close to the entrance of the Science Museum of London.

So, Southwark is not a money-maker. In fact, I've been to Southwark three times now and my average hourly intake is Â£5.64 - which is _very poor_. But it's a good place to practice new stuff in a low-pressure environment and the staff there are really friendly. Plus, for me it's extremely convenient as I live only two stops away on the Jubilee Line.

Anwyay, let's do the numbers.

Today the lunchtime punters at Southwark on a Thursday afternoon were kind enough to give me Â£10.52, mostly in the form of 9x Â£1 coins. So, Â£5.26 for me and Â£5.26 for [Crisis](https://www.crisis.org.uk/).

I was there for 1h50m, which makes my hourly salary Â£5.84. ðŸ™ƒ

### Some notable moments

Hmm. Erm. I played Coldplay's _Green Eyes_ busking for the first time. That's about as exciting as this pitch got I'm afraid.

I guess I could say that after the session I went to Ma's Rotisserie and had a delicious toasted chiabatta with mozzarella, tomato and avocado so... check them out next time you're in the area!

### The first tip

Our old friend _Torn_ got me my first Â£2 tip, which was very nice since it was also the first song of the day and my voice wasn't quite warmed up yet.

### The best performance & biggest tip

The only one which I logged as "Amazing" on my spreadsheet was _Breakfast At Tiffany's_, which incidentally also gave me my biggest tip!

## How to improve

Actually, this was a good stop. I went for less than an hour, it was a good opportunity to warm up - by the time I got to my next pitch, at South Kensington, my voice was well and truly warmed up! Now read about [South Kensington (Pitch 1)](2018-04-12-south-kensington)!
