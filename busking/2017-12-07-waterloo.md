This was my last pitch before going away for my Christmas holiday aaaand... it was a little bit of a disappointment, money-wise. £13.86, or £7.92 per hour.

### The first tip

Yet again, the first song brought the first tip - about £1.50 from one person for _New Shoes_. It's a classic!

### The biggest tips

For the first time in a while, _Torn_ was not the big earner. _Why Does It Always Rain on Me_ was - apparently everybody was feeling a little down that day. During this performance too, a friend popped by to give me some actual CHOCOLATE COINS and some flowers, and an old colleague popped by too to say hello. This was fun!

### The best performance

Probably the above one! Getting chocolate coins was super amazing and hilarious :D
