I've been maintaining a "Side Project Ideas" list for a while now in the form of a Trello board. [Take a look at my Side Projects Trello board now](https://trello.com/b/v4dV9CQS/1-dan-s-side-project-ideas). As you can see, it has loads of items on it. A few of them are extremely vague, and some are a little more well-defined, but most of them are still merely just what the board says: ideas!

I've turned this into a public Trello board for a couple of reasons:

a) I won't ever try out all of them, so if any of these ideas strike a chord with someone else it'd be good for whoever that is to give it a go, and let me know so I can use it.
b) It'd be interesting to hear what other people think about these ideas: criticisms, encouragement, or even existing implementations of the things I've thought about.

Some of them are bound to turn out to be total duds, but it's interesting to maintain a list, and good to have a few simple ideas lying around for rainy days when I feel like starting a new project.
