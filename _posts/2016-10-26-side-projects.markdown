I've been maintaining a "Side Project Ideas" list for a while now in the form of a Trello board. [Take a look at my Side Projects Trello board now](https://trello.com/b/v4dV9CQS/1-dan-s-side-project-ideas). As you can see, it has loads of items on it. Some are vague, others are well-defined, but most of them are what the board implies: ideas!

I've turned this into a public Trello board for a couple of reasons:

- I won't ever try them all out, so if any idea strikes a chord with someone else, they could give it a go. If you do, let me know so I can have a look.
- I'm interested in hearing what people think. Criticisms, encouragement, or even existing implementations of the things I've thought about.

Some of these ideas will turn out to be duds. It's fun to maintain a list, though, and handy to have a few ideas lying around for rainy days when I feel like starting a new project.
