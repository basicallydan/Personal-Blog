## 1: Effective

What a moron. What an utter moron. He's pressing the button before it's even been illuminated. Is this is first time using public transport? How does he not know how this works? He's got headphones on, he's standing at the door, I suppose he's in a rush. So why is he hammering the button before it's been illuminated?

It won't open, you tool!

I won't be distracted by this idiot, though. I've clearly got my shit together _way_ better than him.

Just look at him, though: he's a picture of disorganisation and chaos. His baggy hoodie, his wired 2010 Apple headphones with the frayed sheath. That stupid Yankees cap. I bet he's never even been to New York. _You're not from New York City, you're from Rotherham!_ Haha, Alex Turner had it right. That's a man with his shit together. He and I both know that grungy emotional musician thing is just an act.

No, I won't waste any more cycles on this idiot. He probably hasn't even clocked that I'm looking at him, yet - in a world of his own. Listening to some heavy-on-the-hi-hat, over-produced garbage they try to pass off as music these days.

What he needs is a good podcast. If there's one thing I've learned from commuting on this route for the last 8 years, it's to use your downtime wisely. I can't very well prioritise backlogs when I'm on the overground, but I can listen to _Hack Planet's Daily Dose_ and get my daily life hack from Marissa & Damian.

This bozo probably wakes up at 8am, rolls out of bed, sticks those worn-out earbuds in and--

Shit! There's the light, time to focus.

First through the door, beeline for the staircase.

Here comes a challenger - not today, jumpsuit!

Right: hold onto the rail, three steps at a time, nice and optimised.

Old lady in the way, better let her have the rail I suppose.

"Pardon me."

Manners cost you nothing, Colin. I really am living proof that you can be extremely effective but still personable and friendly. Oh, fucking hell, a pug. Who the fuck still buys pugs? They're abominations! If anything, they're _unethical_. Hipster wanker.

Alright, here we are, ticket barrier. Out comes the _Revolut_ card, one quick swoop. No Apple Pay for me. It's just not fast enough.

Oh, brilliant - speaking of which. Who's this idiot with the phone in front of me?

"Use your card, mate!"

"What?"

"Use your-- never mind, let me through, please!"

"Chill, mate."

Alright, through the gate, only lost a few seconds. Not a PB but not bad. Oh and look who caught up. Mr Big Apple and his poser Yankees cap. Fuck this guy. He's so smug, getting through the gate at the same time. Probably hasn't swung 45kg kettlebells and done 100 burpees this morning though, has he?

No - I won't let him distract me. Ineffective people like him aren't worth wasting cycles on.

Time for work. Those product requirements won't write themselves.

Effective!

## 2: Reflective

What a moron. Did he even see me standing here? We're all trying to get to work, mate. I'm sure you're _very_ important. Probably got all sorts of anxiety disorders, poor bastard. Look at him, so tense, finger hovering over the button like that. Desperate to be the first one out. Just chill, mate. Your spreadsheets aren't going anywhere.

Fucking hell, AirPods, too? Might as well put a sign on your back with "Moped thieves welcome" written in felt tip. I bet he just walks around with those in all day long, not even realising the kind of message he's sending to the rest of us: "No thank you". Fair enough, but don't expect a smile with your latte any time soon.

Is he looking at me? I think he is. Jesus Christ, what's crawled up his arse and died? What's his problem? Can he hear my headphones through his? I can barely hear Maria's voice with the volume at 100%, I'm not turning it down.

Still staring. Well, if he wants me to turn it down he's gonna have to say something. Fuck this guy and his passive-aggressive stare. Reckons he can just walk around the city like he owns the place, judging everybody as he goes. Gimme a break, mate, I'm still jetlagged. I only got in this morning.

I bet he works in some dead-end, soulless job at a faceless bank, shuffling papers around, saying "yes sir" and "no sir" all day long. Working stupid hours, going home late, eating Deliveroo every night and waking up to a pre-mixed Huel shake. Yeah, not even enough time to make his own damn Huel.

What a sorry case.

Oh, the door is beeping, here we go. This dickhead clearly has something to prove.

Not today, wanker. Let's go.

Out the door, slip through the crowd, nice and easy.

What's he doing there, three staircases at a time? Maniac!

Shit, he's gonna hit that granny! What a tosser.

Alright, here we are at the gates, just need to find a good queue - _oh Jesus, watch out for the pug, you idiot_ - nope, not getting behind that idiot with Apple Pay, he'll be there for ages.

Beep. Beep. Beep, excellent, aaaaand... through. Haha, you city wanker prick. Go bankrupt some homeowners. I've got some product requirements to read.
