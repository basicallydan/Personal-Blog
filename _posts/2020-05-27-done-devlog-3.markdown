[Read DoneApp Devlog 2 here](/blog/done-devlog-2).

Today I've got a screenshot to share. It's not hugely exciting, but it's a start. This is my to-do app. It's not just any to-do app. It's the to-do app which specifically fits a use case that I've seen in myself, and only in myself. I think others could find it useful, it's hard to say right now.

I've got login sorted, creating and checking in to tasks. But the creation part is somewhat limited now. I can only choose "Days" as a frequency unit. I want to make a nice iOS-native looking UI for that so I'm gonna search for a library. Shouldn't be hard to roll my own though, just a four-button toggle with Hour/Day/Week/Month or something like that.

Anyway here's the animated screenshot:

I'm tracking progress [here](https://trello.com/c/mV3MomJ6/42-doneapp).
