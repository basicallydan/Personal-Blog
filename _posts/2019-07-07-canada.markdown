It's 7:45 and I'm sitting in a beautiful house overlooking the Strait of Juan Fuca. I'm seven days into a trip around North America which I hope will lead me to deciding where to plant a few roots in Canada.

Back in November 2017, I submitted myself to a pool for getting an invitation to apply for a Working Holiday Visa in Canada. In May 2018, the process had taken several turns but I had finally been approved for a work permit for two years, starting whenever I went into the country and activated it. I did that in April this year with a long-weekend trip to Toronto.
