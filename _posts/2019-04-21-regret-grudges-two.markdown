When I was fifteen, I looked at my 10-year-old self and thought, "what a moron." When I was twenty I looked at my fifteen-year-old self and thought, "so simple-minded!"

When I was twenty-five, I looked back at my twenty-year-old self and thought, "so naive...", and then I wrote [a blog post about it](/blog/regret-grudges/).

Now that I'm thirty (in fact, I'll be thirty-one in a few weeks), I'm surprised at how I think about my twenty-five-year-old self. It's not quite what I expected.

Five years on, I'm feeling a little deflated. Over the last few weeks I've been experiencing somewhat of an emotional rollercoaster. I've felt fairly directionless, looking back at my former self to work out what happened.

Dan at twenty-five was happy-go-lucky and optimistic, but he knew that he didn't have it all figured out. He was very ambitious, but he didn't have a long-term plan. He had direction, though.

This morning, I decided to turn for advice to the person who knows me best: me. So, I've been reading some of my writing from days gone by.

I've been thinking a lot about my younger self and his attitudes, goals, emotions, and how they differ from my own. It's easy to look back on the past through rose-tinted glasses, so when I think of that younger self I imagine him with endless potential, more optimism about the future and a whole lot less fear of failure or his own mortality. How could things change so much in only five-and-a-half years?

Many aspects of my life have changed for the better, and I've had a lot of experiences which have helped to define my personality and outlook as it stands today.

Some of the changes have brought on more responsibility. It doesn't take a genius to see how greater responsibility could change your outlook.

TODO: What's my point here?!?!?!

I believe that looking forward to the future is healthy: try to strive towards something new rather than solely living in the past. Living the past means reliving memories over and over again. It's better to create new, interesting memories than it is to constantly relive old ones. Those old memories _will_ get boring and they'll give you a false sense of your own achievement.

However, there is wisdom to be found in the past.
