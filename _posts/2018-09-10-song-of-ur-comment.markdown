On the /r/AskReddit thread, "Travelers of Reddit, what's a place everyone should visit at least once in their life?", a user called /u/theofiel refused to tell anybody the place they thought everybody should visit:

"I'm not gonna tell you, it's already too crowded there."

They captured a feeling I'm sure we've all felt before while holidaying in supposedly serene getaways. I was entertained and inspired, so naturally, I wrote a song about it.

It was very well-received, and over the next few hours the song was played thousands of times on bandcamp and one generous Reddit user "gilded" my comment to show their appreciation.

A few weeks earlier, on the /r/AskReddit thread, "What was the most epic comeuppance you've ever seen a spoiled kid get?", a user called /u/not_todaysatan responded with a story about a job they had at a pony camp attended by loads of rich kids.

It was an interesting, entertaining story of privilege, entitlement and schadenfreude. So, naturally, I wrote a song about it in the style (vaguelly) of Belle and Sebastian.

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/469074027&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe>

This was the first work I'd done for this new musical (and to an extent, comedy) project, /u/song_of_ur_comment.

I'd had the idea years ago, inspired by Reddit "novelty" accounts like the famous /u/poem_for_your_sprog and /u/Shitty_Watercolour. I'm not a poet, and I'm not that interested in watercolour - but I am a musician and over the past 15 years I've written songs about some _very_ niche topics. There were so many interesting stories out there which I could either re-tell or embellish, in order to practice songwriting, or try new styles, or improve my mixing skills, or - if it turned out well - find a bigger audience for my unusual brand of music.

So, I wanted to give this a go. After years of thinking about it, one night on the 8th of July, I jumped onto /r/AskReddit and started looking for interesting stories. I started by setting the scene, came up with a simple melody, and then re-told the story that /u/not_todaysatan had told but, basically, with more rhymes. It went down well, so I carried on.

On the /r/CasualConversation subreddit, user /u/bmanfromct created a post and told every member of that community, "I really really like it when I smile at a stranger and they smile back." As a fan of this phenomenon, I could relate. I decided to write a song about it.

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/483016839&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe>

This one took just under an hour. By the time I was almost done, it sounded very sweet and sensitive. But, because I'm a 30-year-old child I couldn't help but put some silly backing vocals like "Don't be weird to the strangers" to make it a little comical.

You might notice after listening to some of these that the recording quality varies pretty wildly between the different songs. This is due to a few factors. One: my microphone has an analogue dial for pickup volume, which I change a lot because of different sources. Rarely consistent. Two: depending on the time of day, I might be doing this loudly or quietly. Quietly, of course, if I'm trying not to disturb my neighbours.

Sometimes, I'll reply to a thread which isn't getting a lot of attention despite being (in my opinion) really interesting. Here's one of my favourites, sadly not heard quite as much as the others.

On the /r/AskReddit thread, "Women of Reddit, what do most guys do that really irritates you?", user /u/Delicious_Delilah shared a couple of their pet peeves regarding dating. Again it resonated with me, so I wrote a song about it.

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/484593240&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe>

One of the key challenges of this project is getting timing right. Sometimes, I know a comment song isn't going to get a whole lot of visibility, but do it anyway because it's inspired a really good song. But as I said, part of this is about getting finding an audience. Creating things is fun, but it's a lot more fun when you know that people are enjoying it or being moved by it in some way.

Because of this, I need to work fast and, sometimes, find threads which seem like they're going to be popular. This means potentially sacricificing quality a little bit.

However, I think I got the balance right on this one. On the /r/AskReddit thread, "Drive-thru window workers of reddit, what's the strangest thing you've seen in someones car?", user /u/_Vinyl recounted a story about their dad's bizarre behaviour reversing into a drive-thru Starbucks (classic USA) to avoid having to personally make an elaborate coffee order on behalf of _Vinyl's mother. This story tickled me and it made very good fodder for a song.

This story was already quite funny, all I did was add a little bit of flourish to the story.

I'll end the list there - those are some of my favourites. I hope I'll continue to have the enthusiasm and creative energy to write these songs for a long time because right now I'm really enjoying it. They're all in [a playlist on Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/danhoughmusic/sets/reddit-comment-songs), though, so listen if you wish.

<iframe width="100%" height="250" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/557480718&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe>

The only question is: what will happen to these songs? Do they get upgraded into full-length tracks? Do I start performing them live? Will I put them on Spotify or sell them on Bandcamp? I'm not sure about the last bit, but I think a couple of them could form the bases for longer, unrelated songs. There are some nice melodies in there.

As for performing them: I'm thinking of doing a bit where I explain the premise of the project and audience members decide which subject sounds most interesting and I perform the song for that one. In this, I'd only reveal enough information to make the lyrics the _right amount_ of revelatory and surprising. We'll see on that one.
