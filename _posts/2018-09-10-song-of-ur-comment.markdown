On the /r/AskReddit thread, "Travelers of Reddit, what's a place everyone should visit at least once in their life?", a user called /u/theofiel refused to tell anybody the place they thought everybody should visit:

"I'm not gonna tell you, it's already too crowded there."

They captured a feeling I'm sure we've all felt before while holidaying in supposedly serene getaways. I was entertained and inspired, so naturally, I wrote a song about it.

It was very well-received, and over the next few hours the song was played thousands of times on bandcamp and one generous Reddit user "gilded" my comment to show their appreciation.

A few weeks earlier, on the /r/AskReddit thread, "What was the most epic comeuppance you've ever seen a spoiled kid get?", a user called /u/not_todaysatan responded with a story about a job they had at a pony camp attended by loads of rich kids.

It was an interesting, entertaining story of privilege, entitlement and schadenfreude. So, naturally, I wrote a song about it in the style (vaguelly) of Belle and Sebastian.

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/469074027&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe>

This was the first work I'd done for this new musical (and to an extent, comedy) project, /u/song_of_ur_comment.

I'd had the idea years ago, inspired by Reddit "novelty" accounts like the famous /u/poem_for_your_sprog and /u/Shitty_Watercolour. I'm not a poet, and I'm not that interested in watercolour - but I am a musician and over the past 15 years I've written songs about some _very_ niche topics. There were so many interesting stories out there which I could either re-tell or embellish, in order to practice songwriting, or try new styles, or improve my mixing skills, or - if it turned out well - find a bigger audience for my unusual brand of music.

So, I wanted to give this a go. After years of thinking about it, one night on the 8th of July, I jumped onto /r/AskReddit and started looking for interesting stories. I started by setting the scene, came up with a simple melody, and then re-told the story that /u/not_todaysatan had told but, basically, with more rhymes. It went down well, so I carried on.
