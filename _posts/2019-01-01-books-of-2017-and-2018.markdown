I won't lie. Back in 2016, I went crazy with the books, and [about two years ago I wrote this](/blogs/books-of-2016).

## [Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World](https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/Hard-Boiled-Wonderland-End-World-Haruki-Murakami/0099448785/?tag=daplad-21) by Haruki Murakami

I became quite interested in Japanese Culture in 2016 and for this reason decided early on in 2017 to become acquainted with Japan's (arguably) most internationally well-known author. Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World, originally 世界の終りとハードボイルド・ワンダーランド, is not the sort of book I would like to spoil by talking about it too much here, but I will say that it was certainly unlike most novels I've ever read. Murakami demonstrates sharpness and wit, and a sense of existential resignedness which I tend to find quite appealing. The "hump"[1] of this book was quite far in for me, about 30%, but I did quite enjoy it.

## [The Little Book of Common Sense Investing](https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/Little-Commonsense-Investing-Guarantee-Market-Returns-Profits/0470102101?tag=daplad-21) by John C. Bogle

What a surprise that the man responsible for popularising index funds is writing a book encouraging people to invest in them! I joke, though - Bogle offers compelling, simple, concise arguments for putting most of your eggs in a collection of sturdy, uncomplicated and unexciting baskets made from a diverse range of weave, which will carry said eggs reliably throughout your life. He also succeeds in using much better analogies than me. It's a great read, won't take you long and might help you to understand financial markets a little better.

## [Mother Tongue: The English Language](https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/Mother-Tongue-Story-English-Language-Bill-Bryson/0141040084?tag=daplad-21) by Bill Bryson

Despite being written in the 1990s, this book has aged well. Younger readers (under 20) may be confounded by his description of certain words as "new" in parts, but the points are clear and timeless. He's a total zealot for English, but not unfair to other languages - in fact, he frequently points out ways in which other languages are "better" than English, while still maintaining quite obviously that his native tongue is his favourite. Full of interesting etymology titbits [sic] and wordplay, this was a real page-turner. Check it out if you're interested in language and/or English.

## [The Handmaid's Tale](https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/Mother-Tongue-Story-English-Language-Bill-Bryson/0141040084?tag=daplad-21) by Bill Bryson

A lot of people like to point out how much _The Handmaid's Tale_ feels like a stark warning to people in 2017 worried about a crackdown on civil and human rights. I agree - it is. All dystopian fiction is this. I suspect many people who say they're shocked by it probably haven't read a lot of dystopian fiction. That doesn't make this any less important or shocking, though, and sheds light on an often-underlooked side of this genre, which focuses on the experiences of women in these horrible imagined futures. It's well-written and relateable, a little hard to follow at first but after getting used to the format not difficult at all. Definite recommendation.

## [Modern Romance]() by Aziz Ansari

## [Norwegian Wood](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B005TKD6NY?tag=daplad-21) by Haruki Murakami

## [Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00I3DNUR6?tag=daplad-21) by Haruki Murakami

## [The Metamorphosis](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01N7KS3X7?tag=daplad-21) by Franz Kafka

Now let's look at 2018.

## How Not to Be a Boy (Audio) by Robert Webb

## How to be Champion: An Autobiography (Audio) by Sarah Millican

## Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood (Audio) by Trevor Noah

### Notes

[1]: The "hump" refers to the point at which I become desperately compelled to continue reading a book, and do not want to put it down. Up until this point it can be a struggle, but I don't think a book is necessarily bad for having a deep hump. Some stories/concepts just take a little bit more setup than others. And for some books the hump never comes, but for most it does. Once I am past this point I refer to it as being "over the hump". An easy book for me to read is one where the hump comes early.
